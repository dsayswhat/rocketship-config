rocketship-config
=================

This Drupal feature is meant to save a few steps when standing up a site that will implement 
rocketship in support of Drupal 8 initiatives.

Rocketship scrapes issues from the Drupal.org issue queue by tag, to help organize and assist
initiative owners in giving contributors easy access to priorized and filtered lists of issues.

rocketship-config captures the content type and taxonomy vocabulary needed to make rocketship do its thing.
